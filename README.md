# Svelte Component Library
A growing collection of all my reusable Svelte components and SVGs.

## Components to add
- Tabs
- Loading animations from LoadersToMake
- Standard checkbox with custom animation
  - animated check
- Cubic Bezier curve editor
- Cubic Bezier curve preview
- Image/ Information carousel similar to the new version of my definition component in Wordle+
- Definition component (Wordle+)
### From Web Components
- Standard radio button with custom animation
- Completely custom radio buttons
- Toggle switch (as checkbox if possible)

## TODO
- Look into the issues with the color input component not going away when clicking outside or going away when clicking on the color input
- Look into the accessibility options for the color input & color picker components (arrow key controls etc)
