# Loading Animations
My recreation of various loading animations I have seen across the internet, and some I have created myself.

Places I have recreated animations from include (but are not limited to):
- [hugging face](https://huggingface.co/)
- [minecraft.net](https://www.minecraft.net)
- [loading.io](https://loading.io/css/)
- [svg spinners](https://icon-sets.iconify.design/svg-spinners/)

All recreations have been made without looking at the source code of the originals, and use only CSS, HTML and SVG.
